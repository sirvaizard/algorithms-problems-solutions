// Palindrome Permutation: Given a string, write a function to check if it is a permutation of a palinÂ­
// drome. A palindrome is a word or phrase that is the same forwards and backwards. A permutation
// is a rearrangement of letters. The palindrome does not need to be limited to just dictionary words.

/**
 * Ask: are the comparison case sensitive?
 * Ask: are the strings guaranteed to have the same length?
